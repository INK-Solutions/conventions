Our organisation embraces and operates on the following core values:

* Competence & proficiency
* Autonomy & reliability
* Communication & transparency

The performance of every employee in the organisation would be evaluated against these three criteria.

**Competence & proficiency** is a “hard” skill. It’s an ability to do the core work well, characterised by:

* Following good coding standards (would be defined in a separate document)
* Ability of implementing proper architectural solutions
* Speed of implementing the solution
* General problem solving skills
* Staying up to date with overall technological trends
* Solid understanding of the financial domain

**Autonomy & reliability** are personal traits defined by:

*  Ability to implement the task independently without a need to be micromanaged
*  Taking full responsibility for the work
*  Sticking to the given promises and estimates
*  Getting stuff done, especially when it takes extra effort

**Communication & transparency** are personal traits defined by:

*  Ability to talk to business and understand what’s required
*  Not hiding the problems and mistakes - raising them as they appear
*  Proactive communication when some process/solution can be improved
*  Proactive communication when some problem is found (even if it was not done by the person)
