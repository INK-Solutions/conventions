# Principles


### What is this project about?

This project is a set of best practices and conventions that we as Java Excellence Center are following. 

### Why do we need conventions?

We need conventions because we don't want to think more than necessary.
We want to use our mental energy on solving project-specific problems, rather than problems that are common for all projects.

Besides we would like to open the project written by any of our colleagues and 'feel like home'. Read it: "as little surprises as possible". We don't want to familiarise ourselves with 'yet another project specifics', we want to agree on the best conventions one time and use them over and over (with revising those conventions now and then).   


### How to read this? 

Read this specification in the following order:

* [Values](Values.md)
* [General Policies](/general/General.md)
* [IDE](/tech/ide/Main.md)
* [Reference technology](/tech/reference-technology/Main.md)
* [Project structure](/tech/project-structure/Main.md)
* [Approach to testing](/tech/approach-to-testing/Main.md)
* [Design patterns](/tech/design-patterns/Main.md)
* [Protecting the codebase](/tech/protecting-the-codebase/Main.md)
* [Rest endpoint conventions](/tech/rest-endpoints-conventions/Main.md) 


After that read [reference project](/tech/reference-project/Main.md) specification that showcases all these principles. 
Install it locally and make sure to play around with the project and experiment until everything in it becomes clear.
