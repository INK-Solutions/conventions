# Meetings


1. We are joining with camera. The background should be clean (no mess) and blured (google meet has this option)
2. When we're not talking we're muting ourselves (not to have a background noise that districts others)
3. If it's a standup we mention three things: what was done yesterday, what we plan to do today, what the issues are
4. Stand-ups should not take long, if we need to discuss something with any of the team members we should just mention that during giving our status and discuss it outside the standup (for example we can stay after the call in the limited group)
