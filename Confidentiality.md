# Confidentiality


1. Sometimes we need to store secrets locally for client's env. (for example gitlab passwords, db passwords, etc.) Those should be stored securely (how is up to you). Storing that in text / word files is not an option.
2. None of the client's documentation and specification / confidential info can be shared with anyone who doesn't work for the project. It's preferable not to keep any confidential info / specs locally, but if there's such a need we need to store it securely and delete when it's no longer needed.
