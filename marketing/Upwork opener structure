4. Authority - write about your successful projects, and recomendations (quote some parts from them), and use max 3 quotes from your recommendations
5. Show results - if you don't have your work examples from specific are you can show something similar but write how it's connected. - For eg. we increased reporting accuracy by 50% in UBS. We improved timeliness by 70%

7. Hammer it home - 70% reads the PS of the message first - reinforce that opener is personalized, create urgency, provide a secondary call to action, reinforce your motivation, give something extra, app personalized thought
