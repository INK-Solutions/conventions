# Intellij keyboard shortcuts

### Why to use shortcuts?

Using keyboard shortcuts not only save time by reducing the number of clicks and mouse movements needed to perform common tasks, but they also help to keep your focus on the code.

### How to memorize shortcuts?
**Key Promoter X** plugin for IntelliJ can help. This plugin prompts you with the corresponding shortcut whenever you perform an action using the mouse, gradually helping you to memorize the shortcuts and reducing your reliance on the mouse.
