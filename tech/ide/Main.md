### Why do we use IntelliJ IDE?

IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) used by many developers for Java and other programming languages. Here are some important things you should know about using IntelliJ:

**Navigation**: IntelliJ IDEA provides many shortcuts and features that make navigating your codebase easier. You can use "Go to Definition" (Ctrl + B) to jump to the definition of a variable or method, "Find Usages" (Alt + F7) to find all the places a variable or method is used, and "Navigate Class" (Ctrl + N) to quickly find and open a specific class.

**Code Completion**: IntelliJ IDEA has excellent code completion capabilities. It can predict and suggest code based on what you are typing and can save you a lot of time. You can use "Ctrl + Space" to trigger code completion.

**Refactoring**: IntelliJ IDEA makes refactoring code a breeze. You can use "Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T" to extract a method or variable, "Shift + F6" to rename a variable or method, and "Ctrl + Alt + M" to extract a block of code into a new method.

**Debugging**: IntelliJ IDEA's debugger is powerful and easy to use. You can set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and more. You can use "Shift + F9" to run your code in debug mode.

**Plugins**: IntelliJ IDEA has a large and active community of plugin developers, which means you can extend the functionality of the IDE with plugins. You can browse and install plugins from the "Plugins" menu in the settings.

**Customization**: IntelliJ IDEA is highly customizable. You can configure the appearance of the IDE, set up key bindings, and more. You can access the settings by clicking "File" > "Settings" (or "Preferences" on a Mac).

**Version Control**: IntelliJ IDEA has built-in support for version control systems like Git, SVN, and Mercurial. You can use the VCS menu to commit changes, update your codebase, and more.

**Performance**: IntelliJ IDEA can be resource-intensive, especially on larger projects. You can improve performance by increasing the amount of memory allocated to the IDE in the VM options.

Overall, IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful and versatile IDE that can improve your productivity as a developer. By taking advantage of its features and shortcuts, you can write better code more efficiently.


### Why to use shortcuts?

Using keyboard shortcuts not only save time by reducing the number of clicks and mouse movements needed to perform common tasks, but they also help to keep your focus on the code.

### How to memorize shortcuts?
**Key Promoter X** plugin for IntelliJ can help. This plugin prompts you with the corresponding shortcut whenever you perform an action using the mouse, gradually helping you to memorize the shortcuts and reducing your reliance on the mouse.

### The most useful shortcuts you need to memorize and use:
- Rename (Shift + F6): Allows you to easily rename a variable, method, class, or other element and automatically updates all references to it in the code.
- Navigate to class (Ctrl + N): Allows you to quickly find and navigate to a specific class in your project.
- Navigate to file (Ctrl + Shift + N): Allows you to quickly find and navigate to a specific file in your project.
- Reformat code (Ctrl + Alt + L): Automatically reformats your code according to the project's code style settings.
- Optimize imports (Ctrl + Alt + O): Automatically removes unused imports and organizes remaining imports.
- Find in path (Ctrl + Shift + F): Allows you to search for a specific string or regular expression in your entire project or a specific directory.
- Duplicate line or selection (Ctrl + D): Quickly duplicates the current line or selected block of code.
- Remove line (Ctrl + Y): Quickly removes the current line.
- Comment or uncomment line or selection (Ctrl + /): Adds or removes comments from the current line or selected block of code.
- Basic code completion (Ctrl + Space): Provides basic code completion suggestions based on the current context.
- Select word at caret (Ctrl + W): Selects the current word or selection incrementally.
- Go to declaration (Ctrl + B): Navigates to the declaration of the selected element.
- Extract variable (Ctrl + Alt + V): Extracts the selected expression into a new variable declaration.
- Extract method (Ctrl + Alt + M): Extracts the selected code into a new method.
- Show intention actions and quick-fixes (Alt + Enter): Shows a list of available intention actions and quick-fixes for the selected element.
- Navigate to test (Ctrl + Shift + T): Navigates to the test class or method for the current code element.
- Run (Shift + F10): Runs the current run configuration.
- Debug (Shift + F9): Runs the current run configuration in debug mode.
- Find usages (Ctrl + Alt + F7): Shows all usages of the selected element.
- Generate code (Alt + Insert): Generates code based on the current context, such as constructors, getters and setters, and more.
- Change signature (Ctrl + F6): Allows you to change the signature of a method or constructor and automatically updates all references to it in the code.
- Recent files (Ctrl + E): Shows a list of recently opened files.
- Settings (Ctrl + Alt + S): Opens the IntelliJ IDEA settings dialog.
- Close active editor tab (Ctrl + F4): Closes the currently active editor tab.
- Search action (Ctrl + Shift + A): Searches for and allows you to execute any available action in IntelliJ IDEA.
- Choose what to Paste from clipboard (Ctrl + Shift + V): Shows a popup with a list of recently copied items from the clipboard, allowing you to choose which one to paste. This is especially useful when you have copied multiple items and want to select a specific one to paste without having to repeatedly copy and paste.
