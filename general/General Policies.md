## Meetings
1. We are joining with camera. The background should be clean (no mess) and blured (google meet has this option)
2. When we're not talking we're muting ourselves (not to have a background noise that districts others)
3. If it's a standup we mention three things: what was done yesterday, what we plan to do today, what the issues are
4. Stand-ups should not take long, if we need to discuss something with any of the team members we should just mention that during giving our status and discuss it outside the standup (for example we can stay after the call in the limited group)

## Confidentiality 
1. Sometimes we need to store secrets locally for client's env. (for example gitlab passwords, db passwords, etc.) Those should be stored securely (how is up to you). Storing that in text / word files is not an option.
2. None of the client's documentation and specification / confidential info can be shared with anyone who doesn't work for the project. It's preferable not to keep any confidential info / specs locally, but if there's such a need we need to store it securely and delete when it's no longer needed.

## Vacations
1. If you want to take a vacation agree on the dates with your client (whoever is the business owner / project manager on your project).
2. Chat to #vacations slack channel informing about the days you would be off.
3. Try to plan your vacation at least 1 - 2 weeks in advance.
